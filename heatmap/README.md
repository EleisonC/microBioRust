This is functionality for a heatmap data visualisation in Rust WebAssembly calling d3.js

D3.js (D3 short for data-driven documents) is a Javascript library for dynamic, interative data viz in browsers.
At the moment the heatmap data is coded into the Rust lib.rs, so it is currently working with fixed data
and a rusty colour scheme

To install, you can build with wasm-pack ðŸ“¦âœ¨ 

``wasm-pack build --target web``

And serve it locally, for example with:

``http-server .``

*Installation*
You can install http-server <i>via</i> brew on MacOSX
or with npm

And the server will be located on 127.0.0.1:8080
